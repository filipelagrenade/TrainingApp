### Tasks
Generate .claude/task.md file with a full list of technical tasks for the @claude-overnight.md script to run. These tasks should be informative but concise, only the required information that you would need to complete it without the fluff that will confuse you. These tasks should be based on the feedback from my live tests below. 

Ask me as many questions as required to come up with a comprehensive plan with no knowledge gaps.

### Feedback
- When creating a program, you should be able to duplicate a day you've already made in that create program
I.e. I do leg day on Tuesday and Friday, I don't want to have to recreate it for both days. Could be solved by workout templates generated in a program automatically get added to templates?

- When adding exercises to a template, can it not close the exercise drawer each time? I'd like to just add them all in one go if I had the option. 

- Set types - AMRAP, warmup, normal, drop set
- if drop set is selected should give settings to complete the dropped sets aswell. You developed this in some code that is now lost, it was done via buttons below the row of the current set in the current workout.

- Can we also make the cable attachment, unilateral, RPE and weight types buttons more obvious? I fear they do not look like buttons/aren't intuitive at the moment

- I also don't understand how the weekly score gets assigned, Ive currently got an F however I've done a workout every day and hit a few PRs?

- Pr achievement popup is in pounds, and doesn't correspond correctly with the weights. PRs also don't show in the weekly report

- Need cuff ankle attachment

- Switch exercise on current workout doesn't work 

- Add smith machine to equipment list

- Workout weight type "per side", useful on plate loaded machines

- When generating an AI generated workout or program, there should be toggles or check boxes saying if you want sets and or reps included in the workout generation, and if so what your preferred set count and rep ranges are (can leave blank). 

- You should also be able to use an existing program on an existing mesocycle. I.e. user creates mesocycle and then assigns the program to it. This should add the sets and reps to adhere to the cycle 

- Similar to the old resume workout bug, the start mesocycle card in the periodization screen has all the text in one column. Can you apply the same card as resume workout on dashboard to start mesocycle?

- The AI rep ceilings are too fixed, we live in a variable world. Quite often heavy compounds will have lower ceilings and isolation will have higher, however this differs from person to person. Open to ideas on how to solve this technically, a potential option is have the defaults but allow people to overwrite per exercise

- Are the AI suggested weights stored per workout? They should be attached to a certain exercise so when you add one ad-hoc it pulls the history 

- Review the app, find points of potential UX friction or improvements
