Retrospective set completion editing - need to be able to edit previous sets
Reps box needs to be bigger to allow for 2 digits minimum
After completing a set, next set should be auto populated with weight and rep data from the previous set
Options for super sets, cluster sets, drop sets, AMRAP sets
Add exercise from exercises list just says coming soon, add exercise from the exercise selector on an active workout works
If you have an active workout going on and you want to go back in the app, it should keep the workout running as a background process and it can be resumed, unless the user says cancel workout when they hit back (confirmation dialog). Currently if you go back, there's no way to go back to the ongoing workout and it hard locks you out of starting a new one

Exercise muscle groups should be capitalised on the current workout display (Quads, not quads) - looks more refined
Should be able to add weight OR plates OR bodyweight OR band selection (heavy, medium, light) with weight as the default to an exercise. I.e. I want to track that I just did 2 plates on smith machine squat as it's easier to refer back to, I don't want to track that I did 90kg. Another good example of this is plate loaded leg press where I'm putting 5-6 plates per side. However for something else like a pin loaded machine, weight works well. Leave to user discretion. Obviously the progressive overload assistance will need to be able to cater for this, if doing plates for example we just want micro adjustments like the 1.25/2.5kg plates).

Should have a push notification with the active workout running as well as rest timers, with action button to end workout. Users can opt out in notification settings

Need to be able to add cardio exercises and track times/incline/resistance etc

AI follows different philosophies for progressive overload, Smolov for intense strength, standard PO for hypertrophy 


If you are using a workout template and you add/change exercises, it should prompt you at the end if you want to keep any of the changes, and allow you to select which ones you want to keep

If using an exercise that uses cables, should also allow you to add what grip you used (D handles, wide grip, close grip, mag grip, rope etc)
