## This Session's Work

### Bug Fix Applied
- Fixed 7 type inference errors in `app/lib/features/calendar/providers/calendar_provider.dart`
- Issue: Empty list fallbacks `[]` were inferred as `List<dynamic>` instead of `List<ScheduledWorkout>`
- Solution: Added explicit type annotations `<ScheduledWorkout>[]`

### Verification
- Backend builds successfully: `npm run build` - OK
- Flutter analyzes clean: 0 errors, 1952 info-level warnings (style only)
- All 62 tests passing

## Build Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Backend | OK | TypeScript compiles without errors |
| Flutter | OK | No analysis errors, all warnings are info-level |
| Tests | OK | 62 tests passing |

## Git Status
- Branch: main
- 22 commits ahead of origin/main
