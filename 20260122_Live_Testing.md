Templates created inline in a program need to be added to the general templates section

Current workout needs to have an exercise history view for each exercise so user knows what to do (if not using AI suggestion) 

When creating an exercise, shoulders needs to be split into front delt, side delt and rear delt 

Need to be able to edit templates within the program, especially when AI generated

Update template at the end of the workout didn't work and you need to be able to control the edits made - not just yes to all or no to all

Data doesn't seem to update or refresh on changes until app is restarted 

On the dashboard, what does 90 volume mean?

Weight and reps boxes are too small again since adding the weight scale function

Need a switch exercise function which replaces the exercise at that point in the current workout

Push notifications still not showing at all

 RPE has have steps but only displays ceiling int 

The resume workout banner at the top has all the text in one column, so it's one char per line. Not sure if padding issue

Start program from not the first day, i.e. if it's a 5 day program I should be able to start from day 3. Also should have the option to do workouts out of order in a program, i.e. you could click continue program to just do the next one or you can explicitly select the one you want to do. Currently they're locked

Progressive overload coach doesn't seem to be working, not picking up previous workout data, doesn't show up when ad hoc adding exercises - revise as part of major rebuild below

Persistent AI coach discussion

Need proper AI instead of this shitty lightweight inbuilt. Probably need to work on the backend to run this. AI coach needs to be trained or given resource material to understand training, programming and progressive overload. Resource material found in ./progressiveOverloadKnowledgeBase directory
